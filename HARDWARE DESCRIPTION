The Arduino Nano is the central microcontroller of the system. It serves as the brain of the IoT- based accident detection system. With a compact design, it is ideal for embedded applications in vehicles. The Arduino Nano processes the data received from the accelerometer, GPS, and GSM modules. It makes decisions based on the sensor inputs to detect accidents and trigger alerts. It communicates with the accelerometer via I2C, with the GPS module via UART (Serial communication), and the GSM module via TX/RX for SMS alert transmission. Powered by 5V, the Arduino Nano ensures the smooth functioning of the system, while also being cost-effective and highly compatible with sensors and modules. .

4.2 Accelerometer Module (e.g., ADXL345)  
  
  
The accelerometer module is responsible for detecting sudden changes in the vehicle's motion, such as rapid deceleration or impact, which are indicative of an accident. This module typically works by measuring the vehicle's acceleration along three axes (X, Y, Z). The data from the accelerometer is sent to the Arduino Nano for processing. The ADXL345 accelerometer, in particular, communicates with the Arduino via the I2C protocol, enabling it to monitor real-time acceleration values. The system is programmed to trigger an alert if the acceleration exceeds a defined threshold, such as during a crash or rapid stop. This module is critical for detecting accidents and enabling the system to respond instantly.  
4.3 GPS Module (e.g., NEO-6M)  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
The GPS module is responsible for providing accurate location data during an accident. The NEO- 6M GPS module is widely used in embedded applications due to its compact size and reliable performance. The module communicates with the Arduino Nano using UART (Serial communication), allowing the system to read the GPS coordinates (latitude and longitude) in real- time. Once an accident is detected, the GPS module retrieves the precise location of the vehicle, which is crucial for sending an accurate location to emergency contacts or services. This ensures that rescue teams can reach the accident site quickly. The GPS module is powered by 3.3V or 5V and requires a stable power source for continuous operation.  
4.4 GSM Module (e.g., SIM900)  
  
  
  
  
  
    
The GSM module plays a vital role in ensuring real-time communication. The SIM900 GSM module is used to send SMS alerts to emergency services and predefined contacts. After the Arduino Nano processes the data and detects an accident, it activates the GSM module. 
SMS containing the vehicle’s location and accident details to the relevant recipients. The GSM module communicates with the Arduino via TX/RX serial connections. The SIM900 is highly effective in environments where internet connectivity might be unavailable, making it perfect for real-time communication in rural or remote areas. It works on the 2G network and requires a SIM card for sending SMS messages. 
  
4.5 DC-DC Buck Converter  
  
  
  
  
The DC-DC buck converter is used to step down the vehicle’s 12V power supply to the required 5V to power the Arduino Nano and other modules. It is an essential component for ensuring that the system remains operational without affecting the vehicle's battery. The buck converter is energyefficient, providing a stable power supply that helps prevent voltage fluctuations. Since the system is meant to operate in a moving vehicle, the DC-DC converter ensures consistent and reliable power, even during trips or sudden changes in vehicle power. It plays a crucial role in maintaining the system’s stability and longevity, ensuring that all modules operate without interruptions  
4.6 Power Supply  
The system is powered directly from the vehicle’s 12V electrical system, typically available through the car's battery. This provides enough voltage for all connected modules. The DCDC buck converter ensures that the system receives a stable 5V output. This power supply configuration allows the system to operate continuously without significant strain on the vehicle's battery. In case of power loss or fluctuations, the system is designed to be resilient, ensuring that the vehicle's essential functions and the accident detection system are not compromised. A reliable power supply is critical for the system’s ability to send timely alerts and maintain operations, even during long trips or emergencies.  
4. 7 Wiring and Interconnections  
The system’s components are interconnected using various communication protocols. The accelerometer module and GPS module are connected to the Arduino Nano using I2C and 
Serial (UART) connections, respectively. The GSM module is also connected through TX/RX
